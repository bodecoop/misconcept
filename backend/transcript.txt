00:00 Thank
00:28 you.
00:30 Thank
00:58 you.
01:00 Thank
01:28 you.
01:30 .
02:00 .
02:30 .
03:00 .
03:31 All right.
03:33 Good morning,
03:34 Stats 250.
03:37 Oh, that is not a rhetorical
good morning.
03:39 Good morning,
03:40 Stats 250.
03:41 Thank you.
Good morning.
03:43 Welcome.
03:44 My name is Professor John Keene.
03:47 You can call me Professor Keene,
Dr.
03:48 Keene.
You can call me John if you
03:50 prefer.
03:51 And I'm excited to be your
instructor for introduction to
03:54 data science or, excuse me, data
analysis and statistics this
03:58 term.
Before we get started I want to
04:00 ask a question by quick raise of
hands.
04:03 I realize some people are still
getting settled but for those of
04:05 you who have found a seat how
many people know the names of
04:09 everyone sitting around them?
04:12 Well that's like a 0% success
rate so I'd like to try and
04:16 address that.
04:17 If you can I'd like you to turn
to at least two strangers.
04:23 Introduce yourself by name and
discuss your answers to the
04:26 following questions.
04:28 First, where are you from?
04:29 Second, what was the highlight
of your winter break?
04:32 Third,
04:33 why are you here? Taking stats
250.
04:36 Fourth,
04:37 how might you use statistics in
the future?
04:39 And fifth,
04:40 maybe just to make this a little
bit less cringey.
04:47 What is the photo on your
phone's lock screen and why?
04:53 We'll come back together in
about six minutes time.
04:55 Go for it.
05:22 Thank
05:51 you.
06:19 Thank you.
06:22 Thank
06:51 you.
06:52 Thank
07:21 you.
07:43 Thank you very
07:46 much.
07:59 All right, folks.
08:02 I know that is a quick
turnaround, but if you can
08:05 slowly close out those
introductory conversations and
08:09 bring your focus back up to the
front of the room, I want to
08:11 outline how we are going to be
spending our time for the rest
08:16 of our class period this
morning.
08:17 We only have three things to
tackle between now and when we
08:22 leave out of here this morning.
08:24 I want to take some time to
briefly highlight parts of the
08:28 syllabus that I sent to you
earlier this term.
08:31 I then want to briefly talk
about a key decision
08:35 I want every student to make
between now and basically the
08:39 end of the month about the
lecture formatting approach that
08:43 they'll choose to make over the
course of the semester.
08:45 And then I wanna spend the
remainder of our class period
08:48 actually diving into some
content.
08:51 Talking through lecture one and
introducing basically four key
08:55 pieces of terminology that we'll
be using every other time that
08:59 we meet together as a class.
09:01 To dive into it, I wanna first
highlight that I'm actually one
09:05 of four different professors who
work on this course.
09:09 My colleague,
09:10 Dr.
Alicia Romero, teaches the
09:12 Monday-Wednesday sections of
Stats 250.
09:15 Again, if you just walked in or
didn't catch it at the beginning
09:18 of class,
09:19 I teach the Tuesday-Thursday
lectures for Stats 250.
09:24 To offer you a little bit about
me, I play a lot of volleyball.
09:28 I am an aspiring but bad piano
player.
09:32 And if you catch me around
campus and don't wanna talk
09:35 about your statistics homework,
09:36 you can ask me about
metalsmithing because my husband
09:40 Aaron,
09:41 who has a capacity to like look
manic in front of cameras,
09:45 is a trained goldsmith out of
Ypsilanti in Detroit.
09:49 I've got two dogs named Stanley
and Toby on the left and right
09:52 respectively, who occasionally
are able to visit us and lecture
09:55 a few times throughout the term.
09:57 In addition to Alicia and me,
09:59 there's Mark Rakowski,
10:01 who is the instructor who kind
of governs everything you do in
10:05 labs on a weekly basis.
He designs your lab experiences
10:09 and a couple other things
related to it.
10:12 And then finally,
10:13 Professor Tian-Jie Wang is the
one who organizes our 40 person
10:18 grading team
10:19 that helps to evaluate all the
work you submit on a weekly
10:22 basis and give you good and
reach feedback on what's going
10:25 well and where's an area for
growth.
10:29 All right,
10:31 those are the four lead
instructors associated with
10:33 Stats 250.
10:35 I want to briefly highlight that
our class Canvas page is
10:38 functionally the hub for any
materials or information you
10:42 need to be successful in the
course, and I'd recommend that
10:45 you check it relatively
frequently,
10:47 ideally daily, in part because
any announcements that I think
10:50 we're going you to need over the
course of the week are typically
10:54 posted right at the bottom of
the landing page there, where
10:57 you see the due dates for the
Monday and Wednesday lectures of
11:00 the course, and the due dates
for you guys, the Tuesday and
11:03 Thursday lectures of the course.
11:05 Additionally, you'll see that we
have hyperlinks to any notes or
11:08 class recordings that we think
you're gonna need on a frequent
11:10 basis.
11:12 And while the actual tabs change
over the course of the semester
11:15 to meet our particular needs,
11:16 nearly everything that you're
going to want from the class
11:19 website are available via those
hyperlinks.
11:24 Now, almost in a perfunctual
way, I wanna spend a couple
11:27 times answering the common
questions that students have at
11:30 the beginning of any class.
11:32 First,
11:33 what do you need to bring or
have access to in order to be
11:36 successful in it?
11:38 Stats 250 really only has three
required resources for you, all
11:44 of which are either hopefully
affordable or free to use.
11:47 Starting from the bottom,
11:49 the first platform that we'll be
using on a consistent basis is
11:53 called Posit Cloud.
11:55 Sometime later this afternoon or
tomorrow, I'm gonna send you an
11:58 invitation link to this platform
that I ask you accept so that
12:02 you can get up and running with
the main computational component
12:06 of the class.
12:07 Although this is not a
programming course and my goal
12:10 is not to teach anyone to code,
12:12 I do think that statistical
software can aid in your
12:16 understanding of core concepts
the class introduces.
12:20 And so to that end, most of your
weekly lab assignments will
12:23 involve a small amount of coding
in a statistical language called
12:27 R that most students actually
end up finding very valuable and
12:31 useful to them, both within
Stats 250
12:34 and oftentimes later on in their
major related courses.
12:38 Second,
12:38 we also require that all
students access GradeScope,
12:41 an online homework platform that
we use to submit and return
12:45 student work.
12:47 And then finally, we also
require all students to have
12:50 access in one of two forms to
our class lecture notes.
12:55 I probably sent a few emails to
you about this before class
13:00 formally started,
13:01 that while we don't have
required textbook in Stats 250,
13:05 we have historically found that
students who try and follow
13:09 along with lectures just on
loose leaf paper and pen find
13:13 that the class moves a little
bit too quickly for them to feel
13:16 like they're really engaging.
13:18 And so as a consequence, we
provided students with a set of
13:21 partially completed and
interactive lecture notes that
13:25 you can either purchase in hard
form,
13:28 I see a few students already
have them if you want to hold
13:30 them up for me,
13:32 for cheaper than the cost of
printing around campus,
13:35 or if you're a student who has
access to a tablet and stylus,
13:39 we also have all of the PDFs
available for you to download on
13:43 Canvas so that you can annotate
them digitally if you prefer.
13:47 Again, I'm not gonna monitor or
chastise you if you choose
13:50 neither of these approaches,
13:52 but I am going to make the
argument that literally every
13:54 student who has said I wanted to
take my own notes from scratch
13:57 has later on informed me that
that wasn't the decision they
14:00 should have pursued.
14:01 They should have instead tied
themselves a little more closely
14:04 either to the slide deck or the
raw lecture notes that we use as
14:07 the basis for all of our class
meetings.
14:10 Those are the only three
required resources for you to
14:14 have access to and one thing
you'll be able to gauge this
14:17 morning before we leave out a
class is whether you already
14:20 have access to grade scope and
everything else just fine.
14:24 Other than that I want to also
briefly highlight how you are
14:27 evaluated over the course of the
semester.
14:30 This particular slide tries to
diagram in a flowchart the three
14:36 different grades that we use to
figure out your overall score at
14:40 the end of the semester.
14:42 Weekly exam prep assignments are
worth 10% of your overall
14:47 standing in the class,
14:49 your lab work
14:52 sums to 30% of your overall
grade in the class,
14:56 and your exams sum to 60% of
your overall grade in the class.
15:02 Now what you'll notice in this
diagram is that you are actually
15:06 empowered to make some decisions
about how that 30% and
15:11 60% is actually summed up
together.
15:15 You'll notice that across this
grading scheme, we offer every
15:19 single student in Stats 250
15:21 the choice to take either an
active approach or a traditional
15:26 approach to the lab component in
this class and the lecture
15:30 component of this class.
15:32 And the decision that a student
makes influences how certain
15:37 assignments are weighted.
15:39 Students who elect the
traditional approach for labs
15:41 have a five,
15:43 25% breakdown between lab
assignments and case study
15:46 assignments,
15:47 whereas active approach students
who are attending lab in person
15:51 on a weekly basis have a
slightly different weighting
15:54 scheme.
15:55 Similarly,
15:56 students who opt into the
traditional lecture approach,
15:59 where attending lecture in
person is completely optional
16:03 and not tracked by me in any
meaningful way,
16:05 have their exams weighted at 60%
of their overall standing in the
16:09 course.
Students who commit to attending
16:12 lecture in person,
16:13 taking the active approach,
16:15 and completing a few
lecture-based assignments,
16:18 weighted at 10% of their overall
grade, as a consequence have
16:21 their exams weighted slightly
16:23 more liberally at only 50% of
their overall standing in the
16:27 class.
16:29 Now I wanna highlight that the
decision students make for
16:33 either lab or lecture
16:35 is something that can be a
little bit hard to decide on in
16:39 a vacuum.
16:40 And so to that end, I want to
spend about 10 or 15 minutes
16:43 talking through how you might
make an informed decision about
16:47 whether the active or
traditional approach is best for
16:50 you in this course or whether
some combination of these two
16:54 approaches,
16:55 maybe you make different
decisions across the lab and
16:57 lecture sections of the class,
might best benefit your
17:00 learning.
17:02 In general, this course is
structured so that lectures are
17:05 your first opportunity to engage
with the key concepts Stats 250
17:09 covers.
17:10 And in general, lecture
participation,
17:12 whether it's active in person or
via recordings that we post on a
17:17 weekly basis,
17:18 is essential for success in
Stats 250 and will make it
17:21 easier for you to do well in the
class
17:23 and in general, every single
class session that we have is
17:26 broken down into two components.
17:29 Across our 80 minute meeting,
17:32 I'll take about 45 or 50 minutes
to give a traditional lecture on
17:35 a new topic,
17:36 and then the remaining half hour
will be reserved for students
17:41 who attended that day to work in
small groups on an activity that
17:45 they turn in before leaving out
of the class period that day.
17:49 In general,
17:50 when you are making the decision
between a traditional lecture
17:53 approach or an active lecture
approach,
17:56 you are deciding whether you
want those activities every day
18:01 to count towards your grade or
whether you want them to be,
18:05 or whether you want to be
exempted from those activities.
18:08 Functionally, what that implies
is that students in the
18:11 traditional approach,
18:12 while they could attend lecture
in person,
18:14 they could also engage in the
class remotely,
18:17 viewing recordings on their own
time,
18:19 and the two types of lecture
activities that we offer
18:22 students,
18:23 the pre-work assignments and the
in-class group work assignments,
18:27 are not required,
18:28 they're not graded,
18:29 and students aren't penalized if
they don't complete them.
18:32 In contrast,
18:34 students in the active approach
technically have required
18:37 in-person attendance to lecture
sessions.
18:40 Those pre-working group
assignments are required to be
18:43 completed on a daily basis,
18:45 and students will work in groups
to complete and submit a set of
18:48 exercises by the end of each
day.
18:50 The purpose of these lectures is
to offer students who complete
18:54 those exercises
18:55 relatively immediate feedback on
what they understood from a
18:59 lecture setting.
19:01 The same day that you were first
introduced to the idea,
19:04 you get a little bit of
formative feedback about whether
19:07 you understood absolutely
everything,
19:09 whether a couple concepts that
you needed to review in a little
19:12 bit more detail,
19:13 and so on and so forth.
19:17 Now what I like to do is maybe
call out the elephant in the
19:20 room.
19:21 What is the purpose,
19:22 or maybe what is the motivation
19:24 for picking an active learning
approach that on paper just
19:28 says,
19:29 oh you have more assignments to
complete on a weekly basis.
19:31 And if you complete those
assignments on a weekly basis,
19:33 your exams are weighted a little
bit more liberally.
19:37 And rather than answer that
question myself,
19:39 I'd like to expose you to the
results of a study that was
19:43 conducted on a class that was
formatted basically identically
19:46 to Stats 250.
19:48 There was a paper published back
in 2019
19:51 on a large lecture introductory
physics class.
19:56 And just like I'm offering you
now,
19:58 Students in this physics class
were given the choice between
20:01 what they termed a traditional
or passive
20:04 or an active learning approach
to class.
20:07 And at the very end of the
semester,
20:10 the researchers recorded some
information about how students
20:13 felt the class experience went.
20:18 Did they wish that all of their
physics courses were taught in
20:20 this way?
20:21 Did they feel like their
instructor was effective at
20:23 teaching the content of the
class? Do they feel like they
20:27 learned a great deal from
attending lecture?
20:29 Did they enjoy it?
20:31 And then also,
20:32 what was their exam score at the
end of the semester?
20:36 What I'd like you to do is turn
to a neighbor and reintroduce
20:39 yourself by your first name, if
you've forgotten their first
20:42 name,
20:42 and discuss your answers to one
simple question.
20:46 What is the most striking
takeaway of these results?
20:51 That's a relatively generous
question.
20:53 Striking can be something that
surprises you,
20:56 that confirms a preexisting
belief that you may have had,
20:59 that confuses you,
21:00 that makes you ask more
questions about the results of
21:03 this study.
21:04 I'd like you to turn to a
neighbor to discuss your
21:07 responses to that simple
question.
21:09 What do you find most striking
about these results?
21:12 Go for it.
21:13 Thank
21:42 you.
21:43 .
22:13 .
22:48 All right, folks, I know that
that is a quick turnaround on
22:51 that think, pair, share.
22:53 But if you bring your focus back
up to the front of the room, I
22:55 would be interested in getting a
couple responses from the room.
22:59 What did people find striking
about the results of this study?
23:05 Sure.
23:08 Overall,
23:13 it appears that the course was
more difficult for active
23:16 approach students but they did
better on the test of learning.
23:19 Excellent.
23:20 Anybody want to add on to that?
23:22 Yeah.
23:23 Especially with the blue box
that I feel like I learned a
23:27 great deal through this lecture,
23:28 passwords seem to be higher,
23:29 though active was higher in
testing.
23:32 So, like the actors probably saw
a little link to do things that
23:35 they were doing wrong while they
were doing the assignments to
23:39 fix them for the test of
learning.
23:41 So,
23:41 the notion here we're not only
observing a pattern, but maybe
23:44 providing an explanation of the
pattern.
23:46 It's possible that active
approach students were being
23:49 told that they were wrong on
things, kind of consistently
23:52 over the course of the term and
as a consequence made
23:55 corrections in their thinking by
the time the final exam rolled
23:58 around does that accurately
describe the idea that you were
24:01 communicating excellent other
ideas yeah
24:39 That's an excellent question.
24:40 And maybe if I'm trying to
summarize it to make sure I
24:42 heard it correctly,
24:44 why is it that the active
approach students feel like
24:48 they're in a worse headspace
than the passive approach
24:50 students in terms of their
reflective experiences on how
24:53 the course went.
24:55 My grandfather before he passed
would always tell me,
24:59 you know John,
25:00 90% of people on the road think
they're an above-average driver.
25:05 And he'd always chuckle because
there's something that
25:08 statistically doesn't quite work
with that claim.
25:12 90% of people think they're an
above-average driver certainly
25:16 about half of people need to be
below the average right the
25:21 argument that he was making I
think can help understand the
25:24 results of this study which is
that oftentimes what I worry
25:29 about as a professor of a
Gateway STEM course is that
25:32 students lack feedback they
don't have enough touch points
25:37 over the course of the semester
to correctly gauge where their
25:42 understanding level is of
content that a course is
25:45 covering.
25:46 I have my own personal
experiences in undergraduate
25:49 school where I discovered I did
not understand something
25:55 when I got a test back.
25:57 And I feel like that is the
worst possible time to learn
26:00 that information.
26:02 I'd much prefer to know that
earlier on.
26:06 And in Stats 250,
26:07 we have designed a completely
optional track to kind of
26:11 fulfill that mission,
26:13 give you tons of touch points
26:15 that are very low stakes and
worth very few points so that
26:19 you can trip up on something,
26:22 you can face plant on a concept
without consequence.
26:26 Maybe you don't do so hot on a
lecture activity,
26:28 maybe you don't do well on a
pre-work assignment,
26:31 and it really doesn't matter in
terms of your overall grade.
26:34 So long as you take that
information and act upon it.
26:38 Figure out where that
misunderstanding is, what you
26:40 wanna review a little bit
further so that you're well
26:42 prepared for more heavily
weighted assignments throughout
26:45 the class,
26:46 specifically case studies and
exams.
26:49 Now to that end, I wanna be
clear,
26:52 and I'm sort of editorializing
the choice that I think benefits
26:55 students most.
26:57 But there are many students in
Stats 250 who genuinely are
27:01 better served by the traditional
track because they've got a
27:04 really, really cumbersome some
course schedule and they benefit
27:07 from the additional attendance
flexibility of being able to
27:10 work on the class remotely some
weeks.
27:13 I want you to make the decision
27:16 of whether you'll be an active
or traditional approach student
27:19 for this class
27:20 after you have done three test
runs of the active approach.
27:26 Before we leave out a class this
morning, I'm gonna give you a
27:29 dry run example of a lecture
activity.
27:31 I will do the same thing during
both of our class sessions,
27:35 well lecture two and lecture
three.
27:38 It is only after lecture three,
after you've had three
27:41 opportunities to give the active
approach a dry run,
27:43 do I want you to submit your
decision that locks you in for
27:47 the rest of the term.
27:49 Next week we'll also talk about
how you make a similar decision
27:53 for the lab component of this
class.
27:57 But before we move forward to
other components of the course,
27:59 I wanna pause and ask what
questions you have about the
28:02 ideas we've discussed so far.
28:08 Yes.
28:09 So what happens if you opt for
the active approach and you have
28:15 to miss things because you're
sick?
28:16 Excellent question.
28:17 What if I'm an active approach
student and I get sick?
28:20 Happens.
28:21 The active approach is designed
so you get four guaranteed
28:24 drops.
28:25 What that implies basically is
that we're expecting you to have
28:28 about 80% attendance over the
course of the term.
28:30 I think I'm the only person who
should have 100% attendance
28:34 required.
28:36 Excellent question.
28:37 Other questions?
28:38 Yeah.
28:42 Excellent question.
28:44 Any lecture activity that you
complete before you leave out a
28:47 class is evaluated on a mix of
accuracy and completion.
28:51 In general,
28:52 historically,
28:53 I think the average lecture
activity grade is about a 90 or
28:56 92 percent.
Most students end up finding a
28:59 lot of success on those
assignments,
29:01 in part because,
29:03 I'll introduce them when they
arrive today, but we actually
29:05 have an instructional assistant
team that comes in and
29:07 circulates the room to answer
questions you may have about
29:10 exercises you're working on.
29:14 Excellent question.
29:15 Other questions before I move
forward to a couple other things
29:17 about course logistics?
29:19 Yeah.
29:26 We designed pre-work assignments
to take somewhere between five
29:30 and ten minutes.
29:32 They're meant to literally just
preview the topics that you'll
29:35 be discussing during the next
class session.
29:39 Alright I know that there may be
other questions regarding course
29:42 logistics that I can answer
later on in this morning's class
29:45 period.
29:46 For now I briefly want to touch
on the fact that we have three
29:49 exams in this course.
29:51 They are closed notes,
29:53 pen and paper tests that are
scheduled for February 11th,
29:56 March 19th and April 23rd.
29:59 And before any test in this
class, we'll typically give you
30:03 a practice test along with a
review packet
30:06 and a special office hours
scheduled a week prior that has
30:10 augmented accessibility so that
students can work with GSIs
30:13 during their test prep period.
I want to also highlight that in
30:17 the possible event that you're
enrolled in a class that meets
30:21 during one of those three
evenings,
30:23 we'll circulate a Google form
about a week before the exam
30:26 that allows you to request an
alternate proctoring session.
30:29 And finally, if you're entitled
either to reduce distraction
30:32 seating,
30:33 extended time, or other testing
related accommodations,
30:37 please make sure that you submit
those to the Stats 250
30:39 instructional team,
30:41 ideally by next week Monday,
just so that we can make sure we
30:44 know that you have testing
accommodations and we can plan
30:47 accordingly.
30:49 In addition to those exam
logistics,
30:52 I wanna briefly talk about the
difference between lab and case
30:56 study assignments that together
sum to about 30% of your overall
30:59 grade.
31:00 In general, the lab component of
this course is designed to
31:04 complement or deepen
31:05 the learning that you conduct in
lectures.
31:08 And it provides you with
opportunities to do hands-on
31:11 analyses of real-world data
sets.
31:14 And although, again, I mentioned
this is not a coding or
31:17 programming class, many students
do find that they build an
31:20 introductory proficiency in R,
31:23 one of the most powerful
statistical software language
31:27 available to us these days.
31:29 And I wanna highlight that the
very first lab assignment that
31:32 you'll complete is asynchronous,
31:34 basically asking you to poke
around
31:37 the positive cloud working
environment and get oriented to
31:39 how to actually knit a file and
submit it via Gradescope.
31:44 There are 10 lab assignments
across the semester.
31:48 Three of them we refer to as
augmented case studies.
31:54 In a case study week,
31:56 you'll attend lab just as you
would usually.
31:58 Still conduct an analysis of
some real world data set.
32:02 But in a case study week, you
are also tasked with writing up
32:06 a brief statistical report of
your findings,
32:10 summarizing the results of your
analysis, and in most cases
32:13 trying to make a persuasive
argument based off of those
32:16 results.
32:18 Whether you choose the active or
traditional approach for labs
32:23 influences how the regular lab
assignments are weighted and how
32:27 the case study assignments are
weighted.
32:30 You can find a lot more details
on those weighting breakdowns in
32:34 our class syllabus.
32:36 Finally,
32:37 that third component of the
course that's weighted
32:39 equivalently for students across
all approaches are what we call
32:43 exam prep assignments,
32:45 which are assigned weekly to
give you practice kind of on
32:49 your own time outside of class
on content that we've explored
32:52 in lecture.
32:54 There are 10 assignments total
throughout the semester, and
32:57 although we don't allow late
submissions or offer any kind of
33:00 extension on exam prep
assignments,
33:02 we do automatically drop your
two lowest scores, giving
33:05 students some flexibility when
it comes to completing and
33:08 turning in those assignments.
33:11 That's all I had when it comes
to course logistics.
33:14 There are other details that I
hope you'll read through in our
33:18 syllabus,
33:19 but before we actually
transition into talking about
33:22 some statistical content, I want
to pause and ask what follow-up
33:25 questions you have
33:26 I don't think I
33:32 don't think I see any hands up
and so to that end let's take
33:36 the remainder of our class
period and actually dive into
33:40 talking about some statistical
ideas lecture one is very brief
33:45 we're only going to talk for
about 20 or 25 minutes and it's
33:51 designed to get students in a
place where if they're given a
33:55 data set,
33:55 they can identify the
observational units of the study
33:58 and the variables that describe
them and distinguish between
34:01 population parameters and
statistics using appropriate
34:04 notation.
34:06 My goals are to try and walk
through these two learning
34:08 objectives in about, again,
34:10 20 or 30 minutes time
34:12 and then reserve the last
portion of this morning's class
34:15 period to go through a dry run
of one of those lecture
34:19 activities, active approach
students would be completing on
34:22 a weekly basis.
34:24 To start us off I want to ask
everyone in this room two unfair
34:28 questions.
34:30 I'd like you to turn to a
neighbor and tell that person
34:33 how old you think this person
is.
34:38 Then I'd like you to guess how
old this other person is.
34:43 We'll come back together in
about 30 seconds to review.
34:46 Go for it.
34:50 .
35:31 All right, folks.
35:32 I know that's a quick
turnaround, but I'm slightly
35:35 concerned that I'm bringing out
the worst in us by asking these
35:38 two questions.
35:40 And I want to reveal the answer.
First of all, does everybody
35:42 have a decision for both of
these individuals?
35:46 All right.
35:48 The person on the left is 37,
35:54 the person on the right is 22.
36:03 Now that was a lot of oohs and
aahs for a relatively
36:06 inconsequential game, but I want
to highlight the fact that last
36:10 semester I asked the same
students who are sitting in your
36:13 seats to submit their answers to
record.
36:17 And I wanna show you the
responses that last semester's
36:21 students had when trying to
guess the ages of the person on
36:24 the left and on the right.
36:29 What I'd like you to do is again
turn to a neighbor
36:32 and have a brief discussion
around the following questions.
36:36 What are your main takeaways
from inspecting and comparing
36:41 these two graphs of data.
36:44 You might consider discussing
whether the guesses were biased
36:47 or unbiased,
36:48 and for which photo the observed
guesses were more accurate.
36:53 Turn to a neighbor,
36:54 just like we did previously, to
discuss what you find most
36:56 striking about these results,
36:58 and we'll come back together in
about a minute to review.
37:01 Go for it.
37:22 Thank
37:26 you very much.
37:55 All right, folks, I know I'm
interrupting, but that is a
37:57 quick 60 seconds.
37:59 Just like last time, I'd be
interested in having a few
38:02 people volunteer a summary of
what they just discussed.
38:06 What do you find striking about
how these two graphs
38:09 are similar,
38:10 how they differ, or other things
that you noticed?
38:16 Sure.
38:17 So one on the left has a bit of
a larger range between the two,
38:22 it's kind of like 45,
38:24 and then on the right,
38:26 it's more like convex,
38:35 that everyone could hear, it
appears that the guesses for the
38:39 photo on the left had more
variability or perhaps less
38:44 precision than the guesses for
the graph or the photo on the
38:48 right.
38:49 Other observations?
38:50 I think there might be a bias
towards accuracy in the photo on
38:53 the right because us making the
guess we're closer in age to the
38:59 person pictured in the right
than we are in the actual age of
39:03 the person pictured on the left
so we might have a better idea
39:05 of how to gauge someone's age
with the right.
39:10 Excellent.
I want to restate that so that
39:11 everyone in the room can hear
and also editorialize that
39:14 comment.
The comment makes the following
39:16 observation,
39:18 there's less variability on the
right than there appears to be
39:21 on the left,
39:22 and then it makes a claim.
39:24 The difference in variability
could be due to the fact that
39:28 it's easier to guess the age of
an individual who is close to
39:33 your own age.
39:35 And so a person who is of
college age should be better at
39:40 guessing a 22 year old's age
accurately than a 37 year old's
39:43 age accurately.
In fact,
39:45 that's the type of question that
I wanted to ask on the next
39:49 slide.
39:50 Not whether a person's age
influences the guess that they
39:54 make,
39:56 but whether a person's gender
does.
39:59 Let's take a look at the guessed
age for this 37-year-old
40:04 individual,
40:05 broken apart by whether the
guesser,
40:08 by whether the student
identified as female,
40:12 male, or non-binary.
40:14 I'd like you to again turn to a
neighbor and discuss your answer
40:18 to the following question.
40:19 What are your main takeaways
from inspecting these data?
40:24 We'll come back together in 60
seconds.
40:25 Go for it.
40:52 Thank you.
41:18 All right, folks, I know that's
a quick turnaround, but if you
41:21 bring your focus back up to the
slide in
41:26 contrast with the previous one.
41:29 And I want to try and maybe
interpret
41:34 this first slide as helping us
answer questions
41:39 about a response variable,
41:43 an outcome kind of in a vacuum.
41:46 What is the typical guess for
the photo on the left?
41:49 How much dispersion does it
display?
41:52 Does the distribution of guesses
appear to be symmetric,
41:56 maybe asymmetric,
41:57 does it have multiple modalities
to it, does it appear to be
42:00 unimodal?
42:01 These graphs help us understand
the behavior of a single
42:05 response in isolation.
42:08 In contrast,
42:09 this second slide still displays
information about that response,
42:15 but instead emphasizes how it is
impacted, or perhaps how it is
42:20 associated
42:22 with a potential explanatory
variable.
42:25 Does gender influence the
response of guesses that the
42:30 person in this first photo
receives?
42:33 Is there a relationship between
the gender of the guesser and
42:36 the gender of the guest
individual?
42:40 Those are two different types of
questions that largely describe
42:45 the two halves of our semester
together.
42:48 leading up until spring break,
42:51 we will primarily be interested
in statistical methods that help
42:55 us understand and make claims
about any response variable we
43:01 might be interested in studying.
43:03 And after we return from spring
break,
43:06 we'll change our emphasis to not
so much look at the distribution
43:10 of the response in a vacuum or
isolation,
43:13 but how that response is related
to potential explanatory
43:17 variables.
43:18 And how you go about deciding
whether a prospective variable
43:22 does explain distributional
changes in some response.
43:27 Now that's a lot to tackle over
the course of a single semester.
43:31 How do we describe the
variability or distribution of
43:34 observed data and then how do we
figure out what types of factors
43:37 predict it.
43:39 And in order to tackle those two
big questions, I need to spend
43:42 the rest of our class this
morning talking about some
43:46 foundational terminology we will
use in every class period moving
43:50 forward this term.
43:52 The first thing I want to
acknowledge is that the data
43:55 that I've displayed on the
previous slide and then on the
43:58 next slide
43:59 are actually stored in what
statisticians typically refer to
44:02 as a data frame or a data set.
44:05 And to make sure that we're all
on the same page, I wanna
44:07 briefly highlight the fact that
any time you are working with a
44:11 set of observed data collected
from the world around you, it's
44:14 conventional to list out the
observational units of a study,
44:20 they're sometimes referred to as
the cases of a study, across the
44:24 rows of a data frame.
44:26 And the number of independent
observational units or cases
44:30 observed in a data set typically
determines the sample size of a
44:34 statistical study,
44:36 which statisticians usually
denote with a lowercase n.
44:41 If the observational units of
the study describe the rows of
44:46 our data frame,
44:47 we could label the columns as
variables we have recorded.
44:53 By definition,
44:54 a variable describes any
characteristic of an
44:57 observational unit you might
record.
44:59 And often they form the columns
of an observed sample of data.
45:05 Now when we take a look at the
various things that were
45:07 recorded for this particular
data set.
45:10 Students who were guessing the
ages of photographed strangers.
45:15 I wanna highlight the fact that
not all of these columns
45:19 are describing these
observational units in the same
45:22 way.
45:23 For instance,
45:25 let's take a look at
45:27 the column photo one guess.
45:32 This simply records the age that
a college student guessed for
45:37 that very first individual on
the left.
45:41 Right next to it is another
column
45:46 that classifies that guess as
either being an overestimate,
45:50 an underestimate,
45:52 or a correct guess for that
individual's age.
45:55 And I want to highlight the fact
that if I wanted to,
45:58 I could go through the work of
figuring out the average value
46:02 of the column photo one guess.
46:07 However, it doesn't really make
sense
46:09 to take the average of that
second column.
46:14 You can't really take the
average of the word under, the
46:16 word over, the word correct.
46:19 And that's because these two
different columns represent
46:22 variables of different types.
46:25 Any statistical study that we
conduct in this class,
46:29 let me make that a more grand
statement,
46:31 any statistical study that you
observe inside Stats 250 or
46:36 elsewhere deals with variables
that can be classified into one
46:41 of two types.
46:43 All data that you collect from
the world around you either
46:46 represents observations of a
quantitative variable
46:50 for which taking arithmetic
operations provides meaningful
46:54 information about the sample
you've collected
46:56 or observations of a categorical
variable which groups or
47:02 places an observational unit
into,
47:05 as the name implies, a category.
47:09 In general, when we think about
quantitative variables that we
47:13 might be interested in studying
or categorical responses that we
47:16 might be interested in studying,
47:19 we oftentimes want to think
about how those variables
47:23 operate
47:24 at both the population and
sample level.
47:26 By definition,
47:29 the population of interest
represents the group of
47:33 observational units that you're
interested in learning more
47:35 about.
47:36 Now, in many situations,
47:38 the population that a
statistician or researcher is
47:41 studying
47:42 cannot be fully observed.
47:45 Perhaps the population is too
large.
47:47 For instance, it's very
difficult, even for the federal
47:50 government, to observe every
individual American citizen
47:54 every 10 years during the US
Census.
47:57 It's very difficult to observe
such a population,
48:00 at least because it's very, very
large.
48:03 There are other situations where
the population of interest can't
48:07 be fully observed because it
would be unethical to observe or
48:12 record data on every member from
that population.
48:15 As an example, I was working
with a marine biologist who was
48:19 studying coral reef health in
the South Pacific.
48:22 And in order to collect data on
the health of those coral reefs,
48:27 she had to remove them from the
ocean,
48:30 basically killing every
observation of coral that she
48:34 sampled.
48:36 In such a situation,
48:38 you obviously don't wanna
collect data on the entire
48:41 population that you're studying.
48:43 Doing so would destroy it,
48:44 and so it's in fact more ethical
to only study a subsample of
48:48 that broader group.
48:50 In any of those instances or
even others, statisticians often
48:54 times rely on just taking a
random selection of that
48:58 population.
48:59 A sample from that broader group
and observing how the variables
49:03 behave among that smaller
subset.
49:06 That leads me to maybe two more
pieces of terminology I wanna
49:10 make sure we're all on the same
page regarding.
49:14 By definition,
49:16 a parameter is a numerical
characteristic of a population.
49:22 It could be the population's
average,
49:26 could be the population's
maximum value or minimum value,
49:30 it could be the count of members
in a population that take on
49:34 some categorical outcome.
49:36 And in general,
49:37 in most statistical settings, a
parameter represents
49:42 a fixed,
49:47 true,
49:50 but typically unknown value that
we're interested in learning
49:54 more about.
50:01 In contrast,
50:02 a statistic is simply defined as
a numerical characteristic of an
50:06 observed sample.
50:08 And any statistic that we might
compute to summarize some sample
50:13 of data that we've collected
from the broader population is a
50:17 random
50:20 and typically observed
50:30 value that estimates the
parameter that you are studying.
50:51 As an example,
50:53 let's say that I was interested
in studying a pretty large but
50:58 certainly finite population.
51:01 Let's suppose I'm interested in
studying all All students who
51:05 are enrolled in stats 250 this
semester.
51:08 I think there are about 1800 of
you this term.
51:11 And that's too many for me to
talk to one by one.
51:15 Perhaps I only talk to the
subset of students who happened
51:19 to be sitting in the first row
this morning.
51:22 So we have a subset of two,
51:25 five, eight,
51:26 10 individuals.
51:28 If I ask those 10 individuals,
how many texts have you sent in
51:34 the past two hours?
51:37 Their average answer would be
considered a statistic.
51:40 It's a function of who happened
to decide to sit in the first
51:43 row that morning.
51:45 And whatever that value is,
51:47 maybe it's three,
51:48 maybe it's 30 if you're avid
morning texters,
51:51 that value estimates the true
but unknown average the entire
51:56 population of all Stats 250
students have sent in the last
52:00 two hours and in general these
parameters and the
52:05 statistics that estimate them
are distinguished by different
52:10 notational symbols.
52:13 The last idea that I want to
tackle before we break for a dry
52:17 run of a lecture activity is how
we refer to the average of a
52:22 population compared to the
average of an observed sample of
52:25 data.
52:26 How we would denote the standard
deviation of a population versus
52:30 the standard deviation of a
sample and so on and so forth.
52:35 Let's suppose I'm interested in
understanding,
52:37 on average,
52:39 how old Stats 250 students think
the person in photo one was.
52:43 Whatever that number is,
52:46 I would denote it with the Greek
letter mu.
52:53 And I could estimate that
parameter value using a sample
52:58 of collected data
53:00 using the statistic mu hat.
53:08 Similarly,
53:10 the symbol sigma,
53:12 or specifically lowercase sigma,
could be used to describe the
53:17 variability at the population
level of some quantitative
53:19 variable.
53:21 And that population level
standard deviation
53:23 could be estimated with sigma
hat.
53:30 Finally, if I instead wanted to
look at the behavior of a
53:34 categorical response,
53:36 for instance,
53:37 what proportion of photo one
guesses are classified as
53:41 underestimates,
53:42 I could denote a population
proportion,
53:45 a population percentage, or a
population rate with the symbol
53:50 pi,
53:52 and estimate that outcome with a
sample proportion pi
53:58 hat.
54:05 You'll have the opportunity to
practice matching these symbols
54:08 to their associated quantities
in about five or 10 minutes from
54:12 now.
54:12 Before we get to that additional
practice, I want to offer you
54:16 one last think pair share.
54:19 What I'd like you to do really
briefly is suppose that the
54:23 students in today's class
session are the observational
54:28 units of a survey study.
54:31 Everyone in this room is the
population that I am interested
54:34 in learning more about.
54:36 I give you a quick pen and paper
questionnaire and I ask you the
54:38 following questions.
54:40 How long did you sleep last
night? In what zip code were you
54:43 born?
54:43 How many credits are you taking
this term? And are you left or
54:46 right hand dominant.
54:47 I want you to think about the
answer you would give to each of
54:50 these questions and whether that
response should be considered a
54:54 quantitative outcome or a
categorical one.
54:57 Then,
54:58 I want you to answer a slightly
trickier set of questions.
55:03 Suppose there are two other
questions that I want answered.
55:07 What proportion of the students
in this class are left handed
55:10 and what is the average amount
of sleep in the past 24 hours
55:13 among all students in today's
session?
55:16 Whatever the answers to those
questions are,
55:19 they are not variables.
55:22 Why is that?
55:24 Take two minutes to discuss your
thinking around the questions
55:27 posed on this slide.
55:28 We'll come back to review
together thereafter.
55:30 Go for it.
56:16 .
56:50 All right, folks, I know that's
a quick two minute turnaround on
56:54 that think pair share, but if
you bring your focus to the
56:57 front of the room for the final
time in this morning's class
56:59 period,
57:00 I want to briefly figure out
whether or not your responses
57:04 for how those first four
variables behave match mine.
57:10 I think that the answer to the
question how long did you sleep
57:14 last night prompts a
quantitative response,
57:18 same with how many credits you
are taking this semester.
57:21 I think it's pretty obvious that
the fourth question leads to a
57:24 categorical response,
57:26 but I wanna highlight the fact
that the second question does as
57:29 well.
57:30 When I ask someone in what zip
code you were born,
57:34 some students initially think
that the response is numerical,
57:38 or perhaps is quantitative.
57:41 And although a zip code is a
number, I want to highlight the
57:45 fact that if I tell you my zip
code and you tell me yours and
57:50 we find the average of our two
zip codes, we've learned
57:55 nothing.
57:56 That is a classifying variable.
58:00 If the average of two outcomes
doesn't give you any meaningful
58:05 information,
58:06 it's still a categorical
variable, even if it's denoted
58:09 numerically.
A phone number,
58:12 a UMID number,
58:13 a social security number are all
classifiers.
58:17 They are not things that provide
meaningful averages or sums and
58:20 so shouldn't be considered
quantitative variables.
58:24 I want to also highlight,
58:26 kind of as I previewed, that the
answers to our last two
58:28 questions
58:29 also don't get us variables.
58:33 And the reason for that is this.
By definition,
58:37 a variable must
58:43 describe
58:44 the individual observational
units of a study.
58:52 The quantities that these two
questions are asking for don't
58:57 describe individual
observational units.
59:00 They describe the entire
population of observational
59:04 units that we're studying.
59:07 The answers to these two
questions
59:11 describe the entire population
of interest.
59:18 They are parameters.
59:22 And so they might be denoted
59:25 as the proportion pi of students
in this class who say that they
59:30 are left hand dominant.
59:32 Or the average amount of sleep,
59:35 mu,
59:36 that students in this class got
over the past 24 hours.
59:55 At this point, we've introduced
all the key ideas that we need
59:59 to to do our dry run of the very
first lecture activity of the
1:00:04 semester.
1:00:06 And before we transition to the
last part of this morning's
1:00:09 class, I want everyone to take a
moment,
1:00:11 pause what they're doing,
1:00:12 and crane their neck to the very
back of the room.
1:00:15 What you'll see is that a set of
undergraduate instructional
1:00:19 assistants and graduate student
mentors have joined us and will
1:00:24 join us around this time during
every lecture session that we
1:00:28 have over the course of the
semester.
1:00:31 The only reason why they are
here this morning
1:00:34 is to answer your questions as
you work through lecture
1:00:37 activities.
And so to that end, I encourage
1:00:40 you not to be bashful,
1:00:42 to be greedy with their
attention and to call them over
1:00:45 to ask questions about your own
thinking,
1:00:47 how to approach exercises that
you're unsure of, or anything
1:00:50 else that you want clarified
from the lecture that you just
1:00:53 sat through.
1:00:55 They'll start circulating around
in a moment as you get working
1:00:58 on today's lecture activity.
1:01:00 What I'd like to do is model how
to find it.
1:01:04 In a moment,
1:01:05 or well, you can follow along
now, you can follow along after,
1:01:07 but in a moment I'd like you to
turn your attention to our class
1:01:12 canvas page
1:01:14 which has a tab on the top left
called grade scope sites if you
1:01:20 click on grade scope sites and
then open up the platform in a
1:01:23 new tab you may let me actually
model this for everyone you may
1:01:28 initially be hit with a login
screen like this
1:01:34 one and I want to be clear even
if you have never seen this site
1:01:38 before in your life I do not
want you to sign up for grade
1:01:42 scope I have already done that
for you I want you to log in
1:01:46 ideally using your school
credentials when you click on
1:01:50 school credentials you'll have
the option to pull up the
1:01:53 University of Ann Arbor I think
the fastest way to do that is to
1:01:57 type in the unique and unique
name because no other or college
1:02:00 across the country uses that
idea.
1:02:03 And when you click on that,
you'll be instructed to sign in
1:02:07 with your Shibboleth
credentials.
1:02:11 And from there, you should find
that you're actually enrolled in
1:02:15 two different grade scope
courses associated with Stats
1:02:18 250.
1:02:20 One is where you'll find all of
your weekly exam prep
1:02:23 assignments,
1:02:24 all of your lab assignments,
1:02:25 exams, and case studies.
and the other is the one you
1:02:29 would find all of your lecture
related work if you elected to
1:02:33 take the active approach in this
class.
1:02:36 If you click on that tile,
1:02:37 you should see the very first
group work assignment is
1:02:40 available for you to get started
working on.
1:02:43 And if you take just 30 more
seconds to keep your focus on
1:02:47 the front of the room,
1:02:48 I wanna highlight the fact that
these lecture activities are
1:02:51 designed to be completed
collaboratively.
1:02:54 Ideally in groups of between two
and four students.
1:02:59 What I'd like you to do between
now and the end of this
1:03:01 morning's class period
1:03:03 is take some time to find a
group of two or four students
1:03:06 and actually work through this
dry run of a lecture activity.
1:03:11 Again, I wanna highlight,
1:03:12 it's not graded.
1:03:13 I'll score it for you and return
your evaluations and solutions,
1:03:17 but it does not contribute
toward your overall grade in the
1:03:20 class and is designed to help
you understand whether you think
1:03:23 the active or traditional
approach in the course is going
1:03:26 to better support your learning.
1:03:28 The key set of directions that I
want to leave up in the front of
1:03:31 the room before you get started
are on this slide.
1:03:35 They give you step-by-step
instructions on how,
1:03:38 when you're done with your group
work assignment, you can go
1:03:42 through the steps of tagging all
of the students you collaborated
1:03:45 with.
1:03:47 That's all I've got at this
time.
1:03:49 when you're ready,
1:03:50 turn to a few of your neighbors,
and get started on this dry run
1:03:53 of a lecture activity.
1:03:54 I'll bring us all back together
when there are only about two or
1:03:58 three minutes remaining so that
we can wrap up class.
1:04:00 Let's get to it.
